Hawaii was the last big trip I went on. Loved it, and will be back!
Ireland. Lovely place and have family that live there.
Chicago. My family lives there and I visit the city a lot.
Any and all National Parks. I've been to 10 so far, and want to visit them all in my lifetime.
Fiji someday. Was planning on being there this winter but we don't need to go into that.
